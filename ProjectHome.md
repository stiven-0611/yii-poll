### About ###

The Poll extension for the Yii framework allows you to create custom polls for both anonymous and authenticated users to vote on.

Features include:
  * Basic Gii-created CRUD functionality
  * Portlet to load on additional pages, which displays either the latest or a user-specified poll
  * Polls can be either open or closed to voting
  * IP restricted voting for anonymous users (enabled by default)
  * Authenticated users can cancel their votes on open polls
  * If IP restriction is enabled, you can also configure the ability for anonymous users to cancel their votes (disabled by default)
  * Users must vote on a poll in order to see the results (enabled by default)
